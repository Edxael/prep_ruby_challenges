#     Rectangle Overlap
#
# Write a method overlap which takes two rectangles defined by the coordinates of their corners, 
# e.g. [[0,0],[3,3]] and [[1,1],[4,6]], and determines whether they overlap. You can assume all 
# coordinates are positive integers.
#
# It doesnâ€™t count as overlapping if their edges touch but they do not otherwise overwrite 
# each other. As expressed by a sixth grade student:
#
# This program will catch and fix if values provided by user are wrong.
# Also works with negative values.
